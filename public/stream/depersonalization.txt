TITLE: depersonalization

As I lay there on the hill, my mind begins to race with thoughts and doubts. Suddenly, a sharp pain pierces my skull, and I wince in discomfort. The world around me begins to fade away as I succumb to the overwhelming sensation and drift off into a deep sleep.

I feel myself floating, weightless and untethered. The world around me is hazy and indistinct, like a dream. I see flashes of images, people and places that I recognize, but they are distorted and twisted, as if viewed through a funhouse mirror. Words are flying in the distance twirling, swirling and screaming as a mad horror like the words of a homunculus wretched and wrathful of its own existence.

I find myself standing on the top of the mountain, but it is not the mountain that I know. It is taller, more foreboding, and it seems to go on forever. The air is thick and heavy, making it hard to breathe. I look down and see that I am standing on a narrow path, the only way to go is forward. Darkness and fog surrounds me. Dare I take a step? Who knows that which lies beyond the fog.

What was I thinking about before? All I can focus on are the words screeching towards me.
