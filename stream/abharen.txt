The rays of the sun beat down upon my countenance, illuminating the verdant landscape that lay before me. The soft blades of grass caressed my back, offering a cool respite from the warmth of the day. The hill upon which I reclined was a veritable haven, its incline providing a panoramic vista without the risk of tumbling down its slope. In this tranquil setting, I found solace in the sounds of nature, though occasionally the temptation to partake in the revelries of others would assail me.

Abharen's words echoed in my mind. His middle head seemed particularly invested in the ideas he had presented, but I found myself torn between the various options. They were vastly different from the pursuits that I observed in the distance. The rite of passage that my peers embarked upon, that of scaling the mountain to its summit, seemed a daunting and treacherous undertaking.

As I pondered my quandary, the earth beneath me trembled, drawing my attention to the mountain. A section of its peak had given way, the result of too many climbers attempting to ascend the overhang. Boulders and bodies tumbled down the mountain's face in unison, a tragic sight that had become all too common. With a heavy heart, I lowered my head and returned to my contemplations.

My insecurity gnawed at me, a desire to prove myself by racing to the mountain's peak and claiming victory in the face of adversity. But the fear of failure and the appeal of Abharen's proposal held me back. To pursue his suggestion would spare me the rigors of the climb and the constant comparison to my peers, as well as the threat of the mountain's collapse. However, something within me remained uneasy about this path.
