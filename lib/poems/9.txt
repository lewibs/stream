Once a soul pure and fair,
But now tormented beyond repair.
In the darkness it does dwell,
Trapped in a prison cell.

A mind consumed by endless pain,
Driven mad by an inner bane.
The past, a haunting ghost,
A future, an uncertain host.

A heart that once knew love,
Now filled with hatred from above.
The tears that once fell like rain,
Now dry and gone, never to regain.

In the shadows it does lurk,
A tormented soul, forever to smirk.
A fate sealed by its own hand,
In eternal darkness to forever stand.
