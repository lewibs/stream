An empty phone, a silent screen
A yearning heart, a faded dream
No message from the one we seek
No voice, no word, no glimpse to peek

We check and check, our fingers glide
Over the glass, where hopes reside
But every time, the same old end
No message from our long-lost friend

The memories flood, the heart aches
We wonder where the friendship breaks
But sometimes things are meant to be
No matter how much we wish to see

So let the phone remain at rest
And find some peace, in what is best
For life moves on, and so must we
And cherish what was, in memory.
