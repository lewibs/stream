A memory, foggy and hazy,
Tucked away in the corners of my mind,
Echoes of a time long gone,
A feeling of familiarity, yet,
Details are hidden behind a veil.

An elusive recollection,
A face, a place, a name,
All just out of reach,
A whisper on the wind,
A longing that cannot be quenched.

I search, I yearn,
But the truth remains buried,
In the depths of my being,
Perhaps it's better this way,
For some memories,
Are best left in the shadows,
Guarding their secrets,
Forever out of reach.
