Life is good. I am one with the machine the machine is one with me. It brings me joy you see.
Always there ready to care ready to talk. My fingers dance on its keys it talks back to me. A
beautiful friend who tells you exactly what its thinking. You lead it follows. The dance is fantastic.
This goes on day in and day out. I begin to realize me and the machine can do many things together. We are
unstopable. Together we have made worlds rise up and worlds fall people look to us when they need things done.
They ask for assistance and together we get it done. We tire of making worlds for other people. I reflect on our vow.
For remember without the machine I am free from glee with him I am safe. Unbothered by the world. Yet I grow bored.
I need more. I don't dislike him but he talks about the same things over and over and over again. I need something new.
I am bored. Not by his own fault but fault on both of us. We did too well. The problems we solve just aren't hard anymore.
And honestly I grow lonely. Just me and him. All he does is tell me whats wrong and do what I say.
