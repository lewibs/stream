Alone and at peace, I sit by the lake,
Watching the moon rise, and the ripples it makes.
The occasional car passes by,
But it doesn't disturb my thoughts or my mind.

The story of a man who's seen the world,
Flows through my thoughts like the water unfurled.
I think of the friends I once had,
And wonder where life's path will lead me instead.

As I sit and watch the lights on the lake,
I make a plan for tomorrow and the choices to make.
Life is at a pivot, and I'm at a crossroads,
But for this moment, I let my mind unroll.

There's a girl on my mind, her image so clear,
As I watch the sleeping swan and its ruffled up feathers near.
The sound of the spillway fills my ears,
As I add my thoughts to the clouds without any fear.

It's almost warm, but I don't mind,
For the peace I feel is a rare find.
But then, my fingers burn, and the cigar is out,
It's time to leave, and there's no doubt.

I can't hold on anymore, the moment's gone,
But the memories will stay with me and never be gone.
As I look up and see the stars so bright,
I know that life will be okay, and everything will be alright.
