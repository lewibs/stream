The rain patters down
On the windowpane, a lullaby
For the lonely soul

A symphony of sound
Nature's tears falling to the ground
Cleansing, purifying

Memories flood back
Of a love that once was, now gone
Washed away like rain

The pitter-patter
A soothing rhythm, a reminder
That life goes on, still.

In the still of night
The rain speaks to me, a solace
For my broken heart

But as the dawn breaks
The rain stops, the sun shines through
Hope blooms anew.
