Two hands upon the keys,
Dancing in perfect time,
Creating words and melodies,
A symphony sublime.

One hand leads, the other follows,
In a fluid, graceful flow,
Together they weave a tale,
That continues to grow.

The audience behind the screen,
Looks on with glee,
Watching as the hands dance and spin,
A story for all to see.
Each tap and press, a movement,
A chapter in the tale,
A story of love, or loss,
Or one that's bound to fail.

But through it all, the hands keep dancing,
On the keys they gracefully move,
Weaving words and emotions,
For the audience to approve.

So let the hands keep dancing,
On the keys without a care,
For in this dance of typing,
They weave stories that are fair.
