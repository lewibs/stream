TITLE: echoes_of_failure_a_prison_of_the_mind

I am the voice of self-doubt, the whispers in your ear
Telling you that you're not good enough, that you'll never be
I am the shadow that follows you, the weight on your shoulders
Reminding you of your failures, of all your past missteps and misdeeds

I am the homunculus, the creature of your mind
Wretched and wrathful, a reflection of your fears
I feed on your insecurities, your self-doubt and anxiety combined
Telling you that you're worthless, that you'll never make it here.

I am the voice that tells you to give up, to stay down
To let your dreams and aspirations fade away
I am the one that tells you that you're not worthy of the crown
That you'll never be good enough, not today, not ever, no way.

You'll never escape this place, trapped in your mind
Forever stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and despair
I'll be here to remind you, that you're not of the kind
That can achieve great things, you'll never go anywhere.
