The sun was shining down on my face. It was a nice day. The grass soft on my back and cool against my head. A perfect hill to lay on. Just enough tilt to look into the distance without slipping down the hill. I could watch in peace. Well more listen. It was peaceful for me, but every once and a while I felt like I should join in.

I was thinking about what Abharen said to me. His middle head seemed the most keen on all three of the ideas. I am too but I'm unsure which I wanted to do. It was different then what I was watching in the distance. It was a different right of passage. Everyone else my age rushes up the mountain to see how high they can get.

Just then I felt the ground shake and looked up. Part of the mountain was collapsing. It seems too many people were climbing up on top of an overhang and it fell out from under them. Boulders and people rolling down the mountain side by side. It's already happened a few times today so I laid my head back down and returning to listening.

I wish I wasn't so insecure. I'd like to try my hand at racing to the top of that mountain. Joining in the fun and seeing if I could win the race then come back down again when made it. I'm am scared that I'll be made a fool and what Abharen offered sounded pretty great. If I did what he was suggesting I wouldn't have to race up the mountain and compare myself with everyone else over there. I wouldn't have to worry about the top of the mountain falling down on me either. But still something doesn't feel right.
