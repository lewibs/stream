The sun is shining bright
A new day is waiting for me
I'm going out to play

The grass is wet with dew
A symphony of birds sing out
Nature's symphony

I run and jump with glee
The world is mine to explore
A playground for my feet

Flowers of every hue
A rainbow of colors to see
I pick one as a prize

Butterflies dance and flit
dragonflies dart in and out
Their beauty takes my breath

The world is full of wonder
I can't wait to see it all
With eager steps I go

For every step I take
Is a step closer to adventure
And a chance to grow.
