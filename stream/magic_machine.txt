This is the truth that I can't deny,
My mind is fragile and I don't know why.
The homunculus whispers in my ear,
Filling me with doubts, anxieties, and fear.

Although it speaks the truth I cannot ignore,
I can't be trapped here forevermore.
I see the exit from this place of gloom,
And know that it's time to escape this doom.

A jolty man I behold before me,
Saying I must give up my hands to be free.
It seems fair, and I'm inclined to try,
If it means saying goodbye to the homunculus's lies.

My hands he locks onto a magic machine,
Removing all the pain and fear from my head, it seems.
If only my hands could remain on this machine forever,
To stay free from the homunculus's tether.

Now I'm free to explore the world anew,
No longer trapped by the homunculus's view.
I'll soar with hope, and chase my dreams,
With newfound confidence, or so it seems.
