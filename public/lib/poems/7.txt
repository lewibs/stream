The man who chooses to rebuke,
With words so quick and brash,
Thinks himself quite clever,
But soon reveals his trash.

His tongue is sharp and hasty,
His thoughts are filled with pride,
But in the end, his words are
Just emptiness inside.

For wisdom is not found in
A heart that's full of hate,
And those who choose to rebuke,
Will soon meet their own fate.

So let the fool who chooses
To rebuke and to berate,
Remember that true wisdom
Comes from a kind and patient state.

For in the end, it's not the one
Who speaks the loudest,
But the one who listens well
Who will be found the most just.
